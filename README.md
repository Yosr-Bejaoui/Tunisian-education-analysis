# Tunisian Higher Education Admission Scores Analysis (2022-2024)

A comprehensive data analysis project examining admission score trends, competitiveness patterns, and strategic insights for the Tunisian university system.

## Project Overview

This analysis explores 2,985 program-category combinations representing 148 unique programs across 12 universities and 188 faculties in Tunisia. The study reveals system stability, hierarchical structures, and accessibility patterns that inform strategic decision-making for students, institutions, and policymakers.

## Key Findings

- **System Stability**: Strong year-over-year correlations (r>0.87) with minimal score inflation (-2.2 points over 3 years)
- **148 Unique Programs**: Each program accepts students from 4 different secondary school tracks with varying admission thresholds
- **Score Range**: 64-201 points (2024), ensuring accessibility across all competitiveness levels
- **Predictable Trends**: 3-year patterns enable 85%+ accurate predictions for future requirements

## Key Insights for Stakeholders

### For Students
- Use 3-year average scores + 2-3 point buffer for target setting
- Build portfolio strategy: Reach (target+10), Match (target±5), Safety (target-10)
- Consider integrated preparatory cycles (122-186 points) as alternative pathways
- Monitor high-volatility programs (>15 point std dev) annually

### For Universities
- Faculty-level excellence matters more than institutional size
- Score volatility indicates emerging fields requiring strategic attention
- Wide score gaps signal opportunities for new program development
- Benchmark against similar-sized faculties, not entire universities

### For Policymakers
- System stability validates current frameworks
- Geographic concentration patterns suggest regional development opportunities
- Track-based differentiation validates specialized preparation pathways
- Equity achieved through wide accessibility range (137-point spread)
